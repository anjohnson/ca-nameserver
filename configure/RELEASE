# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.

# EPICS_BASE should appear last so earlier modules can override stuff:
EPICS_BASE = /net/shield/iocapps2/R3.15.5/base/3-15-5-aes1

# These allow developers to override the RELEASE variable settings
# without having to modify the configure/RELEASE file itself.
