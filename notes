Fri Nov 22 09:20:21 CST 2002  -   caDirServ.20021001
	Now test hostname for both "." and ':'.
	Moved ca_flush_io.
	Made some portablility changes.
	Added '-n' option: Input Signal list filename is iocname 
	(else iocname is basename(dirname(name)) )

Fri Jul 23 09:30:31 CDT 2004
	Changes for R3.14 build
		Changes for tsSLList  (init and destroyAllEntries)
		Changes for cas server ( create pvExistTest(3parms) )
		Changes for tsSLIter
		Changes for osiTime, osiTimer (changed to epicsTime, epicsTimer)
		Changes for ca ( ca_task_initialize to ca_context_create)

Mon Jul 30 17:00:00 CDT 2004
	Changes for multiple iocs on a single workstation. 
	Added new class pvEHost for host specific linked list of pvEs. This linked 
	list is used to delete all pvs for a host when it becomes disconnected and
	reconnected.  Removed code for copy and read of private pvlist files.
	Modified installHostName to return pHost*.
	Modified pvE class to contain pHost* instead of pHostName char string.
	Modified filewait class to contain pHost* instead of pHostName char string.
	Changed code to set "struct sockaddr_in ipa" values after channel connects
	not when pHost is created.

	The pHost class now is an ioc class and hostname means iocname (not channel
	ca server name). Multiple ioc's can exist on a single ip host. The iocnames
	now may not have anything to do with the ip host name. The heartbeat pv has
	the name <iocname>:heartbeat. The iocname may be the ip host name in some 
	cases.

	If the search for an unknown pv connects and the ip host is not in the host 
	hash table, use the "host:port" string to create a pHost class and add it to
	the host hash table. 

Fri Aug 20 16:31:23 CDT 2004
	Make nameserver portable.
		No server mode (watcher process) on WIN32.
		No kill and restart scripts on WIN32.
		Remove usage of basename and dirname.
		Remove usage of getopt.
		Remove usage of gettimeofday (use epicsTime).

Tue Oct  5 15:14:09 CDT 2004
	Remove all pvs and remove PH after learned host disconnects.
    Add monitored pv back into pending list.
    Added functions to reserve a file descriptor to use for fopen so
    maximum number of file descriptors will not be exceeded.
    Commented out printfs. Added basename,dirname,iocname for WIN32.
    Removed getopt code - not portable to WIN32. Other WIN32 code changes.

Tue May 10 10:33:33 CDT 2005
	Print ca and cas environment variables to log file at startup.
	Add "static" to appropriate routines.
	Added pvPrefix to command line args (not used yet)

Tue May 17 15:34:25 CDT 2005
	Added nameserver pvs - heartbeat, pvExistTest statistics (hit,broadcast,
	pending, broadcast_denied. ioc_down, ioc_error)

Wed May 18 16:03:11 CDT 2005
	Try reading pvlist file 3 times before giving up to avoid getting
    "Stale NFS file handle" messages.

Thu May 19 10:04:16 CDT 2005
	Implemented setDebugLevel() and generateBeaconAnomaly().
	Call generateBeaconAnomaly() after add_all_pvs() on ioc reboot.
	Added if verbose to fprintf stmnt which preceed setup_logging.

Tue May 24 20:54:34 CDT 2005
	Set a ca connection handler on ALL learned pvs (may be gateway pvs).

Thu Jun  2 16:10:47 CDT 2005
	Added -x to usage line.  Let ca call fdmgr_init().
	Allow pvname to move to a new ioc if old ioc is DOWN.

Fri Jun  3 12:03:47 CDT 2005  - 2.0.0.5
	Added logging timestamp to many messages. Added build time and version.

Thu Jun 23 10:33:24 CDT 2005 -  2.0.0.6
    Use functions to reserve file descriptor for open/close of log file.
    Moved processPendingList and processReconnectingIocs code out of main().
    Use functions to reserve file descriptor for open/close of never.log.

Mon Jun 27 11:18:39 CDT 2005
